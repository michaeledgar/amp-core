<%# This is the blank template file. Here's some information about the
    variables you have access to in your ERb file!
    
    Note: This template is for when you want to print changesets.
    
    revision: the revision number of the changeset you're printing
    change_node: the node ID of the changeset. This will be in binary,
                 so you'll probably want to use hexlify to make it hexy.
    branch: the name of the branch this changeset belongs to
    parents: parents of the revision, as [index, node (as hex)]
    username: the user who committed this changeset
    date: the date this was committed
    description: the message connected to the changeset
    config: the entire configuration of the entire program! This includes
            switches such as :verbose.
    
    Be sure to take a look at the default template, to get some ideas!
