      # This class is a generic "repo picker". It will return a Repository object
      # for the given path (if there is one), and is capable of telling you if there
      # is a repository of its type in the given directory.
      #
      # Amp started off with a MercurialPicker - it knows how to find Mercurial repos.
      #
      # When amp runs, it iterates over all subclasses of AbstractRepoPicker, in no
      # guaranteed order (so don't stomp on existing pickers!), calling #repo_in_dir? .
      # If only one picker returns +true+, then that picker is used for opening the
      # repository. If more than one returns +true+, the user's configuration is consulted.
      # If nothing is found then, then the user is prompted. When the final picker has been
      # chosen, its #pick method is called to get the repository for the directory/URL.
      #
      # This is an "abstract" class, in that all the methods will raise a NotImplementedError
      # if you try to call them.
      #
      # You must subclass this class, or your custom repo code will be ignored by Amp's
      # dispatch system.
